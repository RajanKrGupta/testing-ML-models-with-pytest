# Software Engineering for Data Scientists 01: Testing ML models with PyTest

 Automated tests are a major backbone in any software development pipeline, and this happens due to the fact that we can easily avoid manually testing our piece of code, and instead of this, make our own code test itself. I am sure that if you are interested in building high quality ML models, you will have interest in automated testing your trained models. And before you think this may be a complicated task, we will see how easily it is to setup an automated test pipeline. 
 
 In this repository you will find a basic demonstration on how to use PyTest to perform automated tests on a pretrained model.
